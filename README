I am not quite sure what all I am supposed to put in this READ ME file… 
I just want to make sure I don’t get docked for points cuz I’m going to 
need all the points I can get. 

Challenge One is an MVP. All features work and have been tested 

Challenge Two is an MVP. All most all the requirements have
been met. All the features and layout are to specification.
However, I did not have time to figure you the DateTime equation. 
This challenge also passed all the tests. 

Challenge Three has been a CHALLENGE! 
I have a working application that will display all the badges
in the specified layout. You can call up the Badge individually. 
You can also add a badge. However, it does not have the capability
to add and delete access codes. This challenge also has not been tested. 
This is not an MVP. 

I’m not going to sugar candy coat it, Challenge Three really discourage me. 
I have been working on it 2 days straight… I got some great help,
but still am not seeing it. I don’t know if I’m not remembering the
syntax or I just don’t know how to take the basics and make them into
something more…  All that said…  this motivational guy is not so inspired
after spending two full days on this Challenge without results…
